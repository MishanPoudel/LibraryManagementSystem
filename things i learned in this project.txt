THESE ARE THE THINGS I GOT TO KNOW/ LEARN IN THIS PROJECT

1. File handling
   i) Include the necessary header file: 
      To perform file handling operations in C++, you need to include the <fstream> header.

   ii) Declare a file stream object:
      ifstream inFile;    // For reading from a file
      ofstream outFile;   // For writing to a file
      fstream file;       // For both reading and writing to a file

   iii) Open the file:
      inFile.open("input.txt");    // Open an existing file for reading
      outFile.open("output.txt");  // Create a new file for writing
      file.open("data.txt", ios::in | ios::out); // Open a file for both reading and writing

   iv) Perform file operations:
      *Reading from a file:
         int data;
         inFile >> data; // Read data from the file

      *Writing to a file:
         int data = 42;
         outFile << data; // Write data to the file

      *Closing the file:
         inFile.close();   // Close the input file
         outFile.close();  // Close the output file


2. size_t:
   `size_t` is an unsigned integer type used to represent sizes and indices, 
   with its size varying depending on the platform.

3. find:
   find function is used to search for a substring or character within a string
   find and rfind(reverse find)

4. to_string():
   this function converts any integer to string

5. string::npos:
   It essentially means "not found."
